	<h2>How to make Ugali the Kenyan way</h2>
	<p>Ugali is a staple food in Kenya. It is a common meal found in Kenyan homes and most of us can not even go a week without cooking it. That’s why today we are going to learn how to cook ugali Kenyan way. We will look into what is required, the ingredients and accompaniments too.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A medium sufuria</li>
		<li>2 cups of water</li>
		<li>1 and a half cups of white cornflour</li>
		<li>Wooden cooking stick</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps to follow</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Pour the 2 cups of water into the medium sufuria</li>
		<li>Put the water to boil.</li>
		<li>Add the white cornflour, you could start with one cup first.</li>
		<li>Do not pour the Cornflour or Unga at a go, do it in small chunks while stirring the mixture to mix</li>
		<li>The combination in the sufuria will start thickening</li>
		<li>Once it’s attained the thickness you would want, stop adding the flour as this might cause the Ugali not to cook well.</li>
		<li>Keep turning the ugali from side to side to ensure that it cooks evenly.</li>
		<li>Reduce the amount of heat in order to prevent the ugali from burning before it’s well cooked.</li>
		<li>For it to be evenly cooked, it might take around 20-30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Once cooked, you will smell a sweet aroma, turn it to a serving plate.</li>
