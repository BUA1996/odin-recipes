	<h2>How to make a Chapatti from Home</h2>
	<p>We can't resist a warm chapati with our favourite curry. This traditional Indian side dish is easier than you think and only takes a handful of ingredients. Follow the steps indicated below to make a tasty chapati.</p>
	<p>Below are the ingredients that you need and the step by step guide on how to make a tasty home made chapati.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Wholemeal flour 140g</li>
		<li>Plain flour, 140g plus extra</li>
		<li>Olive oil 2 tbsp, plus extra</li>
		<li>Salt 2 tbsp</li>
		<li>Hot water 180ml</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps to follow</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large bowl, stir together the flours and salt. Use a wooden spoon to stir in the olive oil and enough water to make a soft dough that is elastic but not sticky.</li>
		<li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-10 mins until it is smooth. Divide into 10 pieces, or less if you want bigger breads. Roll each piece into a ball. Let rest for a few mins.</li>
		<li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat until hot, and grease lightly. On a lightly floured surface, use a floured rolling pin to roll out the balls of dough until very thin like a tortilla.</li>
		<li>When the pan starts smoking, put a chapati on it. Cook until the underside has brown spots, about 30 seconds, then flip and cook on the other side. Put on a plate and keep warm while you cook the rest of the chapatis.</li>
